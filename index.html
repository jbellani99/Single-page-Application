                <p class="decor-text">The Earth is home to a vast trove of natural resources, including air, water,
                    soil, plants, animals,
                    minerals, and land, that together allow humans to live and thrive. However, in our brief time on the
                    planet, humans have overused these resources clearing forests and grasslands, burning fossil fuels,
                    and destroying ecosystems with devastating impacts on the long-term health of our planet.

                    But there is another way: WWF believes people can both prosper and use the planet's resources in a
                    sustainable way balancing basic human needs with the need to conserve the natural environment. A
                    sustainable future ensures we stay within the limits of the planet and provides a strong quality of
                    life for generations to come. </p>

                <p class="decor-text">We protect wildlife because they inspire us. But we also focus our efforts on
                    those species like
                    tigers, rhinos, whales and marine turtles whose protection influences and supports the survival of
                    other species or offers the opportunity to protect whole landscapes or marine areas.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cause</h3>
                <p class="decor-text">Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number
                    of ways, including
                    the legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments.
                    This includes such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain
                    animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked
                    activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.
                </p>
                <p class="decor-text">The habitat of any given species is considered its preferred area or territory.
                    Many processes
                    associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying
                    capacity of the land for that species. In many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break
                    up of the wild landscape. Agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented,
                    or relictual, habitat. Farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or
                    forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks.</p>

                <p class="decor-text">The habitat of any given species is considered its preferred area or territory.
                    Many processes
                    associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying
                    capacity of the land for that species. In many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy

                    woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks.

                    Examples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals, changes to natural
                    fire regimes, forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Impact of introduced species</h3>
                <p class="decor-text">Mice, cats, rabbits, dandelions and poison ivy are all examples of species that
                    have become invasive
                    threats to wild species in various parts of the world. Frequently species that are uncommon in their
                    home range become out-of-control invasions in distant but similar climates. The reasons for this
                    have not always been clear and Charles Darwin felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be
                    able to grow abundantly in a place in which they had not evolved. The reality is that the vast
                    majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully. Occasionally, however,
                    some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers
                    significantly, having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment of which they
                    have become part.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chains of extinction</h3>
                <p class="decor-text">This final group is one of secondary effects. All wild populations of living
                    things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them. Large herbivorous
                    animals such as the hippopotamus have populations of insectivorous birds that feed off the many
                    parasitic insects that grow on the hippo. Should the hippo die out, so too will these groups of
                    birds, leading to further destruction as other species dependent on the birds are affected. Also
                    referred to as a domino effect, this series of chain reactions is by far the most destructive
                    process that can occur in any ecological community.

                    Another example is the black drongos and the cattle egrets found in India. These birds feed on
                    insects on the back of cattle, which helps to keep them disease-free. Destroying the nesting
                    habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of
                    insect-borne diseases.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Loss and Extinction</h3>
                <p class="decor-text">This subsection focuses on anthropogenic forms of wildlife destruction. The loss
                    of animals from ecological communities is also known as defaunation.

                    Exploitation of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from
                    Africa 130,000 – 70,000 years ago. The rate of extinctions of entire species of plants and animals
                    across the planet has been so high in the last few hundred years it is widely believed that we are
                    in the sixth great extinction event on earth; the Holocene Mass Extinction. The 2019
                    Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, published by the United Nations'
                    Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, says that roughly
                    one million species of plants and animals face extinction within decades as the result of human
                    actions.

                    Destruction of wildlife does not always lead to an extinction of the species in question, however,
                    the dramatic loss of entire species across Earth dominates any review of wildlife destruction as
                    extinction is the level of damage to a wild population from which there is no return.[clarification
                    needed]

                    The four most general reasons that lead to destruction of wildlife include overkill, habitat
                    destruction and fragmentation, impact of introduced species and chains of extinction.

            <br>

            <h3> OUR MISSION</h3>
            <p >Envisions a world where wildlife is valued by societies that embrace and
                benefit from the diversity and integrity of life on earth and therefore enable biodiversity conservation
                in healthy lands and seas.</p>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="decor-text">Our company is a Section 25 non-profit company incorporated in India and compliant
                with all Indian
                regulations. In accordance with the global mission, WCS-India’s overarching goal is the protection and
                conservation of the natural environment, its flora and fauna, and in particular the preservation of
                wildlife and wild places in India. We combine wildlife conservation action and strategic policy
                interventions with rigorous principles of conservation science, and forge long-lasting productive
                partnerships with governmental and non-governmental partners as well as with local communities. Our
                conservation action addresses the overarching threats of habitat fragmentation, poaching and wildlife
                trade as well as human-wildlife conflict, which impacts our biodiversity and its habitats.

                Based on these principles, WCS-India's work has facilitated the consolidation of critical natural spaces
                while also bringing thousands of marginalized people into the mainstream to access a better quality of
                life.

                Considering the ever-changing facets of the issues and challenges associated with wildlife conservation,
                WCS-India’s objectives encompass a range of ecosystems and species across the country from the dense
                forests of Karnataka and Kerala, and the tropical deciduous forests of Eastern Ghats, to the arid
                grasslands of Rajasthan; from the unique riverine habitats of the North and North East India landscape
                to the vibrant coral reefs of the Lakshadweep Islands.</p>
